# TheAdventuresOfHackergirl
A game intended to get young girls excited about information security!

# About
We started this project during the MLH Prime 2016 Hackathon at Bell Works.

The goal is to expose information security concepts to young women and girls aged 10-14 in a way that is fun and inspiring. Infosec is an important field and recruiting talented individuals of diverse backgrounds is critical to its future. We see this game as one of many tools to achieve that eventual goal.

# Project Status
Currently the project is still in a post-hackathon state. We will work over the coming weeks to get the project to a status where anyone interested can contribute.

If you have any ideas or interest in participating on the project, please don't hesitate to let us know.
